Java command line tool to create PDF visible signature fields
Convenient for testing how they will look like in a PDF without having to make a signed PDF every time

Code: signandvalidation-ws/src/main/java/com/bosa/signandvalidation/service/PdfImageBuilder.java

Build:
  mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
  Or instead of building all sources:
     mkdir signandvalidation-ws/target
     mkdir signandvalidation-ws/target/classes
     javac -d signandvalidation-ws/target/classes signandvalidation-ws/src/main/java/com/bosa/signandvalidation/service/PdfImageBuilder.java

Show command line params:
  java -cp signandvalidation-ws/target/classes/ PdfImageBuilder

Run:
  java -cp signandvalidation-ws/target/classes/ PdfImageBuilder ...

  
Note: the fonts are taken from the OS (Linux in case of the FTS server)
Most fonts differ from OS to OS but Serial and Courier fonts are likely present on all platforms.
Also present on the FTS server is the 'freescpt' font.
To try out this font, you can download it from https://fontsdata.com/37131/freestyle-script.htm and save in the current dir as freescpt.ttf (case sensitive)
